# UK veraPDF image

This image is meant to check the validity of provided PDF/A files according to
university provided profile.

Read more about validation here: [cuni.cz/UK-7987](https://cuni.cz/UK-7987.html)

The validation profile file (currently `UK-7987-version1-custom9.xml`) and the
VeraPDF version are taken from the above page. If you spot a new version of the
file, please open an issue here so that the docker image can be updated
accordingly.

# Usage

## TL;DR way with prebuilt docker

First, pull the docker image:
```sh
docker pull ghcr.io/mff-cuni-cz/cuni-thesis-validator:latest
```

Run the verification:
```sh
cd path/to/thesis/directory/with/thesis/pdf
docker run -v $PWD:/thesis ghcr.io/mff-cuni-cz/cuni-thesis-validator verify /thesis/thesis.pdf |grep validationReports
```

## Building the container

The docker image is built as such:
```sh
cd path/to/cuni-thesis-validator
docker build -t thesis-validator .
```

## Using the container

Once you are in the container run the verify script with your pdf as an single
argument

```sh
verify my-thesis.pdf
```

The command will dump the verapdf output. To gather the result as a return code
you need to do something like:

```sh
verify my-thesis.pdf | grep 'isCompliant="true"'
```

Note that this is highly dependent on the format of verapdf output. If you find
a better way, please feel free to report it here as an improvement.
